**Abstract**  
  
Accessibility is a central concept in transportation and has been described as a holistic measure that brings together land use and mobility. This concept has numerous implementations, but virtually all share the way accessibility is measured as an attribute of pairs of origins and destinations. Borrowing from precepts in network science, this paper’s objective is to propose a centrality measure called betweenness-accessibility, coupling the familiar betweenness indicator with accessibility. This measure is useful to estimate incidental eﬀects of accessibility on networks as potential for interaction is reﬂected on them. The new measure is illustrated using a reproducible example and the city of Zurich, Switzerland, as a case study. Utility and applicability of betweenness-accessibility are discussed.
